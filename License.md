- You cannot rename it and pass it off as your own work (Don't be that person)
- You can use it as a reference for API bug fixes (I encourage it! fix your bugs!)
- You can use it inside another project (eg. video editor, streaming app) as long as you don't expose decoder/encoder API.

- You can fork, make improvements (but please send back upstream to benefit everyone) as long as you retain the name PopH264
- You cannot try and make loopholes to circumvent this license.
- You don't have to pass credit, but if you do, credit PopH264 so if anyone else contributes they are credited too, and can help the project.
- You cannot remove this license from your source.
- You can commission me to add features, API support, fix bugs. graham@newchromantics.com

I will replace this with a proper established license when I have time.
